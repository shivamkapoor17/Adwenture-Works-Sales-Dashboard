Hello EveryoneðŸ‘‹

âœ… I want to show you something great i.e. my new dashboard showing sales insights of Adventure Works which is a imaginary company sell's bikes and accessories.

âœ… But wait a minute the greatness does not lies in the dashboard itself but it lies in how I made it and what concepts and tools I used to build it. So hear me out.

âœ… I Actually follow the approach used in real industry, I first created a Data Warehouse using data modeling techniques and some tools and then build a dashboard out off of that data warehouse.

âœ… Tools I Used:

âœ” SSIS for moving the data from source to staging and from staging to core and doing some transformations in between i.e. ETL.

âœ” SQL for creating scd type 2 and some stored procedures.

âœ” SSAS for creating Data modal (table relationships) and for writing DAX queries.

âœ” Power BI and Power BI report builder (Paginated Report) for final dashboard building. That's the whole process I followed.
